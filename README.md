## Check Your Understanding
1. I would choice option (1) within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. It is important to test regularly and intermittenly through the development process to catch issues early and fix them with much less cost. Hence, I would not run the tets only after development is completed. Additionally, if it is possible to automate running tests with Github actions cheaply, I would since it removes the extra step of running the tests manually and ensures tests are run the same way each time.

2. No, I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output. This is a more isolated check that would be more suited toward unit testing.

3. Navigation mode analyzes the performance, accessibility, and SEO when the page of the site initially loads during a fresh visit. In contrast, snapshot captures a static view of the current at a particular moment and performs its analysis on that instead.

4. Three things to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results are:
   1. Add a `<meta name="viewport">` tag to the HTML code.
   2. Add a meta description to improve SEO.
   3. Properly size the images to save data and improve page load time.
